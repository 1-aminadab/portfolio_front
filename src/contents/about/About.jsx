       <p>
        Hi, I'm Amanuel, a full stack developer with 2.5 years of experience. I specialize in creating beautiful and functional web applications. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I seamlessly transition between different parts of the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have a degree in Computer Engineering and have freelanced on appwork for various clients, gaining valuable experience and honing my skills. Working on appwork has provided me with opportunities to work on diverse projects and collaborate with clients from different industries. Through these experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of client requirements and the ability to deliver high-quality solutions within deadlines
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always excited to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, reading tech blogs, or attending meetups and conferences to expand my professional network.
